            <p>
                I am a 35 year old Puerto Rican web developer with science and art background. I love to spend my free time renovating my home, playing and working on personal graphic art, and animation projects. I love scifi and fantasy literature and
                series.

            <h3>More About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I have studied Digital Art and Computer Animation with Laurus College, in California, but have always been interested in web development and programming. While in the Navy, I worked as a Machinist's Mate in the Steam Propulsion Plant of 3 different ships, and while it was rewarding work, and I learned a lot, I have always liked working with computers. took my first steps towards my new career in January 2023, and started the Immersive Software Developer coding program with FullStack Academy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a highly motivated and ambitious person and even though I'm introverted I can definitely work with a team. I especially enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high precision. I am talkative and sociable but also known for getting "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work like programming or designing.
